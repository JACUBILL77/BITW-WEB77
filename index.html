<H1>Welcome to my life. </H1>

<H2>So essentially what im going to do is give you a brief rundown about me. </H2>

<a href="https://www.mlb.com/dodgers" target="_blank">Official website of the Dodgers!</a>
<p> I was born on August 4th, 2003. The first interesting fact about me is that I love baseball, I always have. My favorite baseball team is the Los Angeles Dodgers. <p>

<p> I have lived in Safter CA. my entire life. I have a little sister, her name is Imani, and she is a handful. I was an only child for 15 years and 21 days. Me having a sister is probably the only interesting things about me. I'm pretty boring I stay in to my room watch baseball, do homework, and thats basically it.</p>

<p> As much as I am a Dodger fan, I am also a baseball fan, the best basebll player in he world plays in LA, but not for the Dodgers. Mike Trout is arguably the greatest baseball player of all time. He is fast, has light tower power, and has a cannon of an arm.</p>
